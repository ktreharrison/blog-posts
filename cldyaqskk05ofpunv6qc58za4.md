2.  **_Increases efficiency:_** By automating repetitive tasks and catching errors early, [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) saves you time and effort in the long run. You can focus on writing new code instead of fixing oldÂ code.
3.  **_Encourages code consistency_**: By enforcing consistent coding styles, [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) helps to keep your codebase organized and easy to read. This makes it easier for others to understand and contribute to yourÂ code.
4.  **_Enhances development workflow:_** [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) integrates seamlessly with your existing development tools and workflows, making it easy to use and implement.

#### How to UseÂ [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ)

[Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) is easy to set up and use. Hereâ€™s how you can getÂ started:

1.  Install the [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) package from PyPI using pip or your preferred packageÂ manager.
2.  Create a configuration file in your project directory, which defines the rules that [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) will follow when analyzing yourÂ code.
3.  Run Sourcery in your project directory to analyze your code and generate suggested improvements.

#### Installation

[Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) can be installed viaÂ pip:

pip install sourcery

After installation, you can run Sourcery in your project directory to analyze your code and generate new files with proposed improvements.

#### Code Examples

Here are a few examples of how Sourcery can improve your PythonÂ code:

1\. Type hints: Sourcery can automatically add type hints to your code, making it easier for others to understand what each variable represents. This also makes it easier to catch type errors before they become a problem.  
2\. Automatic documentation: Sourcery can automatically generate documentation for your code, saving you time and effort. This makes it easier for others to understand how your code works and what it does.  
3\. Exception handling: Sourcery can help you catch and handle exceptions more effectively, improving the stability and reliability of your code.  
4\. Code refactoring: Sourcery can recommend changes to your code that make it more readable and maintainable. This can help you write better code that is easier to understand and modify in the future.  
  
**Example 1**  
Hereâ€™s an example of a code refactoring that Sourcery canÂ perform:

Suppose you have the following code that calculates the factorial of a givenÂ number:

def factorial(n):  
if n == 0:  
  return 1  
else:  
 return n \* factorial(n-1)

While this code works, it can be improved in terms of readability and maintainability. For example, the function could benefit from adding a docstring and using a more descriptive variableÂ name.

Sourcery can automatically perform these improvements for you with just one command. After running Sourcery, you might see the following updatedÂ code:

def factorial(num: int) -> int:  
  """Calculate the factorial of a given number.  
  Args:  
  num (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.  
  Returns:  
   int: The factorial of the given number.  
 """  
  if num == 0:  
   return 1  
 else:  
   return num \* factorial(num - 1)

As you can see, Sourcery has added a docstring to the function, indicating what the function does and what it returns. It has also added type hints to the parameters and return value, making the function easier to understand and use. These small improvements can make a big difference in the readability and maintainability of yourÂ code.

**Example 2**  
Hereâ€™s an example of how Sourcery can refactor a long nested loop into a more concise and efficient list comprehension:

Suppose you have the following code that creates a list of squares for a given range ofÂ numbers:

def create\_square\_list(start, end):  
  squares = \[\]  
  for i in range(start, end + 1):  
    for j in range(i):  
      squares.append(j \*\* 2)  
  return squares

While this code works, it can be improved in terms of readability and efficiency. By using a list comprehension, we can simplify the code and make it runÂ faster.

[Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) can perform this optimization for you with just one command. After running [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ), you might see the following updatedÂ code:

def create\_square\_list(start, end):  
  """Create a list of squares for a given range of numbers.  
  
  Args:  
   start (int): The start of the range.  
   end (int): The end of the range.  
  
  Returns:  
 list: A list of squares for the given range.  
 """  
 return \[j \*\* 2 for i in range(start, end + 1) for j in range(i)\]

As you can see, [Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/invite/kqMdSInZ) has transformed the nested loops into a single list comprehension, making the code more concise and efficient. This small optimization can make a big difference in the performance of your code, especially when dealing with large dataÂ sets.

You also can hoover over your function and get a metrics on your code such as size, complexity, working memory and a qualityÂ score:
