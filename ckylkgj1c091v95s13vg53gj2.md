As the world becomes more technologically advanced, knowing how to read and/or write code will become more important than ever. Even in roles that are non-technical, you could give yourself a competitive advantage by knowing one of the major programming languages. Worst-case scenario is, you will learn skills that can help increase your productivity, improve your creative and logical thinking, automate daily routine tasks or create beautiful web visuals. Not too bad if you ask me !

Now, if you are new to coding/programming languages, don’t sweat it. The series of websites below are sites where you can get hands-on and learn some of the most popular programming languages. I even taught myself new technical skills from the resources that follow. Ready ?

1.  **Exercism.org**

I had to learn the hard way there is more to a website than HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The LandChad.net, a site with the intent to “turning internet peasants into Internet Landlords” by demonstrating how to setup websites, email servers, chat servers and everything in between.
